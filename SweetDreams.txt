Sweet Dreams (Are Made of Bagels)

Sweet dreams are made of wheat
Who am I to disagree
I travel the world and the seven seas
Everybody's looking for bagel

Some of them want salt bagel
Some of them want toasted salt bagel
Some of them want plain bagel
Some of them want to be plain

Sweet dreams are made of wheat
Who am I to disagree
I travel the world and the seven seas
Everybody's looking for bagel

Hold your head up, chewin' on, keep your head up, chewin' on
Hold your head up, chewin' on, keep your head up, chewin' on
Hold your head up, chewin' on, keep your head up, chewin' on
Hold your head up, chewin' on, keep your head up
