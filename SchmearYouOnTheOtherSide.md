===================

*Bagels, a thousand, thousand bagels*
*Choosing, the time has passed for labels*
*Golden breads are toasting over, yeah*
*I can't seem to taste you, bagie, although my mouth is open wide*
*But I know I'll taste you once more*

*When I schmear you, I schmear you on the other side*
*Yes, I’ll schmear you, I'll schmear you on the other side*

*Toasting, I hate to see you burn*
*Schmearing, I hate to see you turn*
*Salt and wheat forever, yeah*
*Though I know we must be sliced as sure as sesames are on the side*
*I'm gonna schmear you when you're fully toasted*

*When I schmear you, I schmear you on the other side*
*Yes, I’ll schmear you, I'll schmear you on the other side*

*Never thought I'd eat like this*
*Strange to be so full, yeah, but we'll be together*
*Creamed cheese, Creamed cheese, Creamed cheese*
*Fill me, fill me up, I'm eating*
*Up the stairs, other people meeting*
*I'm hungry, I need you bagel, yeah*
*I was hungry, but now I'm filling up with the great carbohyde*
*I know you're toasting but I'll stop you toasting*

*When I schmear you, I schmear you on the other side*
*Yes, I’ll schmear you, I'll schmear you on the other side*
*I'm gonna schmear you, I'll schmear you on the other side*
*Dog knows I'll schmear you, I'll schmear you on the other side, yeah*
*I'll schmear you, schmear you on the other side*
*Yeah, I'll schmear you, schmear you on the other side*
*I wanna schmear you, schmear you on the other side*
*I hope I schmear you, schmear you on the other side*
*Yeah, I came to schmear you, schmear you on the other side*
*I wanna schmear you, schmear you on the other side*
*I wanna schmear you, yeah, yeah, yeah, schmear you on the other side*
*Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, schmear you, schmear you on the other side*
