===========

Ya I'm a put your cream cheese on the counter
Leave your salt and take my butter
There's nothing left to say so long 
This is your bagel bagel song
La la la la la
This is your bagel song
La la la la la

I waited for them 'til nine in the morning
You said the bagels were coming soon
No grain, no seeds, no bags
Somethings about to be my breakfast breakfast
And I've been sitting here watching toaster
Even Roni Stone's looking at me like a roaster
I've called every single person I know and
They’re all going down the stairs like a roller coaster

So what am I to do? (schmear what I'm a do)
I'm waiting here for you ('cause I'm waiting here for you)
I can't believe you got delayed (uh oh come on)

Ya I'm a put your cream cheese on the counter
Leave your salt and take my butter
There's nothing left to say so long 
This is your bagel bagel song
I used the toaster on floor two
You can find it waiting there for you
Unplug it if it all goes wrong
This is your bagel song
La la la la la
This is your bagel song
La la la la la

Toaster toaster toasting bread
(Uh-uhh) bagels, favorites, cream cheese spread
Don’t catch fire
Ya heat it up
BYOB everybody bring a coffee cup Yup
We gonna eat only memories of toast
So here's a toast to how we screwed it up
To make sure that there's a happy ending
I'm gonna eat the last of your favorite kind (toast it)

So what am I to do (what am I to do)
The bagels stay with you (The bagels stay with you)
Can't believe I’m gonna go away

Ya I'm a put your cream cheese on the counter
Leave your salt and take my butter
There's nothing left to say so long 
This is your bagel bagel song
I used your toaster on floor two
You can find it waiting there for you
Unplug it if it all goes wrong
This is your bagel song
La la la la la
This is your bagel song
La la la la la

bagel, bagel, have a nice breakfast

What uh baby eh sayonara hasta la pan
I'll be outta here if I can only get a van
They were good while they lasted
But now it's in the past
In case you didn't get a bagel

Well now that all that's said bagel you know uh

Now come on schmear come on

Ya I'm a put your cream cheese on the counter
Leave your salt and take my butter
There's nothing left to say so long

You can find it waiting there for you
Unplug it if it all goes wrong
