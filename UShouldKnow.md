[U Should Know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUBDdlbgCIo)
===================

*Do you crave me like I crave you*  
*Do you wait and pine onto the counters*  
*Like I do*  
*I'm in you, you, you got me good*  
*I'm plain, enriched but I like it*  
*Why am I baking up alone?*  
*I guess I like it, the feeling of feeding you*  
*Why am I so salty?*  
*So salty of losing you*  

*Bagel U should know*  
*That I like it when you do what you do*  
*Bagel U should know*  
*I don't hide it,*  
*When I like what you do to me*  

*Don't give me the tyme*  
*You taste me to test*  
*Only with you that can I do*  
*What I do best*  
*I'm in you, you, you got me good*  
*And I'm gonna treat you right if you want it*  
*Why am I keeping you so round?*  
*When I know I'm gonna hurt when you're gone*  
*Why am I so salty?*  
*So salty of losing you*  

*Bagel U should know*  
*That I like it when you do what you do*  
*Bagel U should know*  
*I won't hide it*  
*When I like what you do to me*  

*Bagel U should know*  
*I like it what you do, ooh*  
*Bagel U should know*  
*I like it, ooh, what you do to me*  

*I like it, what you do to, what you do to me*
