*Muffin*  
*Tell your butter not to melt my way*  
*Tell your preserves not to hear my words*  
*What they mean*  
*What they say*  
*Muffin*  

*Muffin*  
*Can you keep them in the cupboard for life?*  
*Can you hide them from the waiting world?*  
*Oh muffin*  

*Bagel*  
*Gonna spread your cream cheese out tonight*  
*Gonna have some on my face*  
*Oh bagel*  

*Waiting for the toaster light*  
*But if you wanna seed poppies with me*  
*I can feed you little pips*  
*Till you're bursting*  

*Waiting for the toaster light*  
*And if you wanna seed poppies with me*  
*I can feed you little*  

*Muffin*  
*Tell your jellies not to hold my hand*  
*Tell your condiments I'm a bad man*  
*Oh muffin*  

*Bagel*  
*If you're boiled baked bread for me*  
*Are you covered in everything?*  
*Oh bagel*  

*Waiting for the toaster light*  
*And if you wanna seed poppies with me*  
*I can feed you little pips*  
*Till you're bursting*  

*Waiting for the toaster light*  
*And if you wanna seed poppies with me*  
*I can feed you little*  
*Yea*  

*Waiting for the toaster light*  
*But if you wanna seed poppies with me*  
*I can feed you little pips*  
*Till you're bursting*  

*Waiting for the toaster light*  
*And if you wanna seed poppies with me*  
*I can feed you little pips*  
*Wo-oh*  
*Muffin*  
*Yea*
