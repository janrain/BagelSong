===========

*One, two*  
*One, two, three, four*  

*On the road again*  
*Just can't wait to get on the road again*  
*The life I love is eating bagels with my friends*  
*And I can't wait to get on the road again*  

*On the road again*  
*Eatin' flavors that I've never had*  
*Spreadin' schmears that I may never spread again*  
*And I can't wait to get on the road again*  

*On the road again*  
*Like a band of bakers we go down the highway*  
*We're the best of friends*  
*Insisting that the world keep toasting our way and our way*  

*Is on the road again*  
*I just can't wait to get on the road again*  
*The life I love is eating bagels with my friends*  
*And I can't wait to get on the road again*  

*On the road again*
