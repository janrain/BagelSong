[Way I Are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5rLz5AZBIA)

I ain't got no money  
I ain't got no car to take you on a date  
I can't even buy you flour  
But together we could be the perfect soul mates  
Talk to me girl

(Oh) Bagel, it's alright now, you ain't gotta bake for me  
If we go dutch you can still have some bread, it's free  
We can work without the perks just you and me  
try it out 'til we get it right

Bagel if you toast, you can get a crumb  
'Cause I like you just the way you are  
(I'm about to toast and I'm well prepared  
Can you enjoy me the way I are?)  
I don't need the spread or the cream cheese  
Boy I like you just the way you are  
Let me see ya toast, you can get a crumb  
'Cause I like, I like, I like...

I ain't got no dry yeast  
I ain't got no gran-ulated sugar  
We can't bake nothing exotic  
It don't matter 'cause I'm the one that loves you best

Talk to me girl

(Oh) Bagel, it's alright now, you ain't gotta bake for me  
If we go dutch you can still have some bread, it's free  
We can work without the perks just you and me  
try it out 'til we get it right

Bagel if you toast, you can get a crumb  
'Cause I like you just the way you are  
(I'm about to toast and I'm well prepared  
Can you enjoy me the way I are?)  
I don't need the spread or the cream cheese  
Boy I like you just the way you are  
Let me see ya toast, you can get a crumb  
'Cause I like you just the way you are

Bagel girl, I don't got quality bread I rent plain white wonder bread  
Listen Bagel girl, I ain't got a salt bagel but I can share my bread  
So listen Bagel girl, once you get a dose of toasted bread you gon' want some mo'  
So listen Bagel girl, when I'm toasted I want you there, want you there, yeah.  
(oooohh ooh whoahh!)  
(oooohh ooh whoahh!)  
(fade)
