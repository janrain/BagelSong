[I Will Wait For Bagels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qupakqi28lE)
==================

*The clock will tick away the hours one by one*
*And then the time will come when all the waiting's done*
*The time when bagels arrive and find me here, hungry*
*Straight to my waiting plate*

*If it takes forever, I will wait for bagels*
*For a thousand Fridays, I will wait for bagels*
*Till bagels are delivered here*
*Till I'm holding a bagel with cream cheese*
*Here on my plate*

*Anywhere you wander, anywhere you go*
*Every day remember how I love you so*
*In your heart believe what in my heart I know*
*That forever more I'll wait for you, bagels*

*If it takes forever, I will wait for bagels*
*For a thousand summers, I will wait for bagels*
*Till bagels are delivered here*
*Till I'm eating bagels*
*And forevermore I'll wait for bagels*
*I will wait for bagels*
*Yes, I will wait for bagels*
*I will wait for bagels*
