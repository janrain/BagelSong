[Stuck On You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJ355Yrf_FY)

*I smelled you toasting from a far*  
*Then in a bagel bar*  
*I claimed I didn't care for you.*  
*But your smell got trapped inside my nose*  
*Over and over again*  
*You fed yourself to death in me.*  

*I thought I'd drop you easily*  
*But that was not to be*  
*You tasted like a yummy bread.*  
*So you invade my sleep*  
*And confuse my dreams*  
*Turn my nights to hungry itch.*  

*Stuck on you, til' the end of time*  
*I'm too tired to fight your taste*  
*Stuck on you, til' the end of time*  
*You've got me satisfied.*  

*Holding on the bagel bag*  
*I smell your boiled-ness*  
*You're everywhere inside my room.*  
*Even when I'm all alone*  
*I want your yummy-ness*  
*You're everywhere inside of me.*  

*You've got me trapped*  
*I can't escape*  
*Your delicous taste*  
*When you beam it out*  
*All across the sky*  
*No I can't escape*  
*Your delicious taste*  
*When you shoot it deep*  
*Straight to my belly.*
