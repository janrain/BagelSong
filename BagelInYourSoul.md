[Bagel In Your Soul](https://youtu.be/o6WKE4aYgOw?t=18s)
======================

*I'm your only friend*  
*I'm not your only friend*  
*But I'm a little gluten friend*  
*But really I'm not actually your friend*  
*But I am*  

*Blue toaster in the outlet by the light switch*  
*Who watches over you*  
*Make a little bagel in your soul*  
*Not to put too fine a spread on it*  
*Say I'm the only carb in your breakfast*  
*Make a little bagel in your soul*  

*I have a secret to tell*  
*oh that delectable smell*  
*It's a simple topping and I'm leaving out the salmon and jell's*  
*So the room must listen to me*  
*Masticating vigilantly*  
*My spread is blueberry cream cheese low-fat L-I-T-E*  
*My story's infinite*  
*Like the kitchen toaster line, it doesn't rest*  

*Blue toaster in the outlet by the light switch*  
*Who watches over you*  
*Make a little bagel in your soul*  
*Not to put too fine a point on it*  
*Say I'm the only bread in your breakfast*  
*Make a little bagel in your soul*  

*I'm your only friend*  
*I'm not your only friend*  
*But I'm a little gluten friend*  
*But really I'm not actually your friend*  
*But I am --*  

*There's an office opposite me*  
*Of the keeper of the pantry*  
*Which worked to restock stores and kept the kitchens chip crumb free*  
*Though I respect that a lot*  
*I'd be fired if that were my job*  
*After killing Coors Light off and countless eng. team donut walks*  
*Blue toaster of friendliness*  
*Like guardian angels its always near*  

*Blue toaster in the outlet by the light switch*  
*Who watches over you*  
*Make a little bagel in your soul*  
*Not to put too fine a point on it*  
*Say I'm the only bread in your breakfast*  
*Make a little bagel in your soul*  

*(And while you're at it*  
*Keep the bake light on inside the*  
*toaster in your soul)*  

*Not to put too fine a point on it*  
*Say I'm the only carb in your breakfast*  
*Make a little bagel in your soul*
