[The Rose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiXDcmDctg)

*Some say love, it is a river that drowns the tender reed*  
*Some say love, it is a razor that leaves your soul to bleed*  
*Some say love, it is a hunger, an endless aching need*  
*I say love, it is a bagel and you its poppy seed*  

*It's the heart that fears the breaking, that never 'ttempts the schmear*  
*It's the dream afraid of waking, that never tastes the lox*  
*It's the one who won't baking, who cannot seem to toast*  
*And the dough afraid of falling, who never learns to rise*  

(spoken)  
A friend  
is someone who knows  
the flavor in your heart  
and toasts it for you when you forget the taste  
Attack*  

*When the night has been too lonely and the road has been too long*  
*When you think that love is only for the lucky and for the strong*  
*Just remember in the kitchen far beneath the boiling steam*  
*Lies the dough that with the ove's love*  
*In the spring becomes the bag-el*
