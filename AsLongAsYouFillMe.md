===========
*As long as you fill me*  
  
*Although hunger has always been a friend of mine*  
*I'm leavin' my craving in your spreads*  
*People say I'm crazy and that I am blind*  
*Risking it all to smother your breads*  
*And how you got me starving is still a mystery*  
*I can't get you out of my head*  
*Don't care what you're topped with in the bakery*  
*As long as you're here with me*  
  
*I don't care how you taste*  
*Where you're baked*  
*If you're crisp*  
*As long as you fill me*  
*How you taste*  
*Where you're baked*  
*Don't care if you're crisp*  
*As long as you fill me*  
  
*Every little thing crumb you have shed from*  
*Feels like theres more emptiness in me*  
*Doesn't matter if you're you're owned by someone*  
*It seems like we're meant to be*  
  
*I don't care how you taste (how you taste)*  
*Where you're baked (where you're baked)*  
*If you're crisp*  
*As long as you fill me (I don't know)*  
*How you taste (how you taste)*  
*Where you're baked (where you're baked)*  
*Don't care if you're crisp*  
*As long as you fill me (yeah)*  
  
*I've tried to hide it so that no one knows*  
*But I guess it shows*  
*When I look at at you with my eyes*  
*If you're crisp and where you're comin from*  
*I don't care, as long as you fill me, bagel*  
  
*I don't care how you taste (how you taste)*  
*Where you're baked (where you're baked)*  
*If you're crisp*  
*As long as you fill me (as long as you fill me)*  
*How you taste (how you taste)*  
*Where you're baked (where you're baked)*  
*Don't care if you're crisp (yeah)*  
*As long as you fill me (as long as you fill me)*  
*How you taste (how you taste)*  
*Where you're baked*  
*If you're crisp*  
*As long as you fill me*  
*How you taste (how you taste)*  
*Where you're baked (where you're baked)*  
*As long as you fill me*  
*How you taste*  
*As long as you fill me*  
*If you're crisp (I don't care)*  
*As long as you fill me*
