[Bagels Don't Cry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q460cEwJgCI)
============

*I would say, I'm full*  
*If I thought that it would change your mind*  
*But I know that this time*  
*I've ate too much*  
*Been too unkind*

*I try to laugh about it*  
*Cover it all up with shmear*  
*I try and laugh about it*  
*Spreading the shmear in my eyes*  
*'Cause bagels don't cry*  
*Bagels don't cry*

*I would break bread at your feet*  
*And beg for more bagels*  
*Plead with you*  
*But I know that It's too late*  
*And now there's nothing I can do*

*So I try to laugh about it*  
*Cover it all up with shmear*  
*I try to laugh about it*  
*Spreading the shmear in my eyes*  
*'Cause bagels don't cry*

*I would tell you that I was full*  
*If I thought that you would stay*  
*But I know that it's no use*  
*That you've already gone away*

*Misjudged your hunger*  
*Pushed you too far*  
*Took you for granola*  
*I thought that you needed it more*  

*Now I would eat most anything*  
*To get you back by my side*  
*But I just keep on laughing*  
*Hiding the shmear in my eyes*  
*'Cause bagels don't cry*  

*Bagels don't cry*  
*Bagels don't cry*
