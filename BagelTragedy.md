Bagel Tragedy
=============

*Alone at night*  
*I am hungry*  
*I need to find*  
*All the spreaders for my cheese*  

*When I wake at night*  
*Hunger inside*  
*What should I eat?*  

*I shut the door and traveled to a bakery*  
*I met a baker man, he seemed to be alone*  
*I felt that he had bagels*  
*He shared with me that night;*  

*"Lad did you know that bread was buttered here?"*  
*"This bagel tragedy was talked about for years"*  
*The bagel is gone forever*  
*Only crumbs and seeds remain*  
*It was eaten*  
*It was so good*  

*Without lox*  
*Without cheese*  
*There can be no tasty snack*  

*Without bread*  
*Without wheat*  
*There can be no circle treat*  

*As the man baked on*  
*I started to find the cheese*  
*I learned about a small pantry*  
*A hidden room still today*  

*I tried to get more bagels*  
*But he said, "You want too much"*  
*Then he turned away and left me*  
*As I stand there wanting more*  
*He said, "You'll get your fill*  
*As your future holds bagels"*  

*Without lox*  
*Without cheese*  
*There can be no tasty snack*  

*Without bread*  
*Without wheat*  
*There can be no circle treat*
