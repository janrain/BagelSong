===========

*Another bread bakes slowly*  
*Toaster is slowly toastin'*  
*And if appetence causes the silence*  
*Who are we mistaking*  
*But you see it's not me*  
*It's not my family*  
*In your bread in your bread*  
*They are eating*  

*With their salt and their cheese*  
*And their cheese and their grain*  
*In your bread in your bread they are spreading*  

*In your bread*  
*In your bread*  
*Bagel bagel bagel el el*  
*What's in your bread*  
*In your bread.*  
*Bagel, bagel, bagel el, el, el, oh do,do,do,do,do,do,do,do*  

*Another mother's baking hearth is taking over*  
*And the appetence causes silence*  
*We must be mistaken*  
*It's the same old thing since 2005*  
*In your head in your bread*  
*They're still baking*  
*With their salt and their cheese*  
*And their cheese and their grain*  
*In your bread in your bread they are boiling*  

*In your bread*  
*In your bread*  
*Bagel bagel bagel el el*  
*What's in your bread*  
*In your bread.*  
*Bagel, bagel, bagel el, el, el, oh do,do,do,do,do,do,do,do*
