*There was a roll*  
*An under water roll who controlled the yeast*  
*Got killed by ten million pounds of flour*  
*From New York and New Jersey*  

*This bagel's gone to Heaven*  
*This bagel's gone to Heaven*  
*This bagel's gone to Heaven*  
*This bagel's gone to Heaven*  

*The baker in the roll*  
*Got sucked in a hole*  
*Now there's a hole in the roll*  

*And the bread's not cold*  
*And if the bread's not cold*  
*Everything is gonna toast*  
*We'll all take turns, I'll get mine too*  

*This bagel's gone to Heaven*  
*This bagel's gone to Heaven*  
*This bagel's gone to Heaven*  
*This bagel's gone to Heaven*  

*Rock me Joseph, Alberto, Santiago*  

*If Bread is 5, if Bread is 5, if Bread is 5*  
*Then the Bagel is 6, then the Bagel is 6*  
*The Bagel is 6, the Bagel is 6 and if the Bagel is 6*  
*Then Salt is 7, then Salt is 7, then Salt is 7*  

*This bagel's gone to Heaven*  
*This bagel's gone to Heaven*  
*This bagel's gone to Heaven*
