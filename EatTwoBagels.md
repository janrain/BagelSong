*I eat two bagels in the morning, I eat two bagels at night*  
*I eat two bagels in the afternoon, it fills me up alright*  
*I eat two bagels when I'm hungry, and two when I'm full*  
*I eat two bagels before I eat two bagels, and then I eat two more*  

*Oh, my daddy he once told me, "Son, you be hard working man"*  
*My mama she once told me, "Son, you do the best you can"*  
*But then one day I met a man who came up to me and said*  
*"Hard work good and hard work fine, but first eat lots of bread"*  

*So now,*  
*I eat two bagels when I get up, in the car I eat two more*  
*I eat two bagels when I write some code, and when I request a pull*  
*(I eat two bagels)*  
*I eat two bagels when I'm hungry, and two when I'm full*  
*I eat two bagels before I eat two bagels, and then I eat two more*  

*Oh, my daddy he once told me, "Son, you be hard working man"*  
*My mama she once told me, "Son, you do the bet you can"*  
*But then one day I met a man who came up to me and said*  
*"Hard work good and hard work fine, but first eat lots of bread"*  

*I eat two bagels in the morning, I eat two bagels at night*  
*I eat two bagels in the afternoon, it makes me feel alright*  
*I eat two bagels when I'm hungry, and two when I'm full*  
*I eat two bagels before I eat two bagels, and then I eat two more*  

*EAT TWO BAGELS*  
*That's what I do*  
*EAT TWO BAGELS*  
*Come eat two bagels with me in the morning*  
*EAT TWO BAGELS*  
*Come eat two bagels with me in the afternoon, yeah*  
*EAT TWO BAGELS*  
*Hey, would you rather eat two bagels or rather do your work?*  
*EAT TWO BAGELS*  
*I knew you were going to say that!*  
*EAT TWO BAGELS*  
*EAT TWO BAGELS*  
*That's what I do!*  
*EAT TWO BAGELS*
