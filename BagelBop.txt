Hey ho, let's go
Hey ho, let's go
Hey ho, let's go
Hey ho, let's go

They're formin' in a straight line
They're goin' through a kitchen
The spreads are meltin’ again
The Bagel bop
They're piling by the toaster
They're turning on the roaster
Cookin’ up the bagel
The Bagel bop

Hey ho, let's go
Crowded by the bags now
Which they want, I don't know
They're all debating, unready to go

They're formin' in a straight line
They're goin' through a kitchen
The spreads are meltin’ again
The Bagel bop
They're piling by the toaster
They're turning on the roaster
Cookin' up the bagel
The Bagel bop

Hey ho, let's go
Crowded by the bags now
Which they want, I don't know
They're all debating, unready to go

They're formin' in a straight line
They're goin' through a kitchen
The spreads are meltin’ again
The Bagel bop
They're piling by the toaster
They're turning on the roaster
Cookin' up the bagel
The Bagel bop

hey, ho, let's go
hey, ho, let's go
hey, ho, let's go
hey, ho, let's go
