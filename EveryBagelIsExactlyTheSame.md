===

_*a lamentation on store-bought bulk bagels in a time of COVID*_

===

I believe I can see the future
'Cause I repeat the same routine
I think I used to have a *palate*
Then again, that might have been a dream
I think I used to have a voice
Now I never make a sound
I just *eat* what I've been told
I really miss when they would come around
Oh no

Every *bagel's* exactly the same
Every *bagel's* exactly the same
There is no *poppy* and *there's no whole grain*
Every *bagel's* exactly the same

I can feel *those seeds* are watching
In case I *chose* myself *a plain*
Sometimes I think I'm happy here (Sometimes)
Sometimes, yet I still pretend
I can't remember *'fore COVID* started, oh
*And* I *can't* tell you exactly *when* it will end

Every *bagel's* exactly the same
Every *bagel's* exactly the same
There is no *poppy* and *there's no whole grain*
Every *bagel's* exactly the same

*Miss eating* on a little *plate* of paper
I'm hoping *ses'me I* might find
*Did it hide behind that ev'rything?*
*No need to* look behind
I am still inside
*A little bite, still bland but true*
I wish this could've been any other way
But I just don't know, I don't know
What else I can do

Every *bagel's* exactly the same
Every *bagel's* exactly the same
There is no love here and there is no pain (Every *bagel*)
Every *bagel's* exactly the same (Exactly the same, Every *day*)
Every *bagel's* exactly the same (Every *bagel*)
Every *bagel's* exactly the same (*There's no whole grain*)
There is no *poppy* and *there's no whole grain* (Every *bagel*)
Every *bagel's* exactly the same (Every *bagel's* the same)
