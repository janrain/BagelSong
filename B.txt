What's coming through is alive.
What's holding up is a bagel.
But what's singing songs is a snake
Looking to turn this yeast to bread.

They're both totally void of hate,
But baking bread just the same.

The snake behind me hisses
What my bagel could have been.
My bread before me begs me
Open up my oven again.

And I feel this coming over like a storm again.
Artisanally.

Pumpernickle voice, tempts me,
Drains me, feeds me,
Leaves me cracked and empty.
Drags me down like some wheat everything.

The snake behind me hisses
What my bagel could have been.
My bread before me begs me
Open up my oven again.

And I feel this coming over like a storm again.

I am too connected to you to
Slip away, to fade away.
Days away I still feel you
Baking bread, changing me,
And artisanally killing me.

Without the crust,
Beneath the storm,
Under these seeds
The walls came down.

And the snake is drowned and
As I look in the dough,
My fear begins to fade
Recalling all of those rolls.

I could have cried then.
I should have cried then.

And as the walls come down and
As I look in the dough
My fear begins to fade
Recalling all of the rolls
I have died
and will die.
It's all right.
I don't mind.

I am too connected to you to
Slip away, to fade away.
Days away I still feel you
Baking bread, changing me,

And artisanally killing me.
