*So you think I'm hungry?*  
*But being hungry's the only way to be*  
*When you eat bagels*  
*You spend life fighting for your sanity*  

*This is a boiled roll*  
*You better know what you're waiting for*  
*This is a boiled roll*  
*Do you know what you're waiting for?*  

*If you want to be free*  
*Below the bread is the only place to be*  
*'Cause in this life*  
*You spend time running from Einstein Bros*  

*This is a boiled roll*  
*Do you know what you're waiting for?*  
*This is a boiled roll*  
*You better know what you're waiting for*  
*This is a boiled roll*  
*You better know what you're waiting for*  
*This is a boiled roll*  
*Do you know what you're waiting for?*  

*Bring wheat to the weak and bring yeast to the strong*  
*May all evil stumble as it flies in the world*  
*All the tribes comes and the toasted will crumble*  
*We must brave this night and have faith in bread*  

*I'm trying to find my peace*  
*I was made to believe there's something wrong with me*  
*And it hurts my heart*  
*Lord have mercy, ain't it plain to see?*  

*That this is a boiled roll*  
*Do you know what you're waiting for?*  
*This is a boiled roll*  
*You better know what you're waiting for*  

*This is a boiled....*  
*This is a boiled roll*  
*You better know what you're waiting for*  

*Do you know? It's a boiled...*  
*Do you?*  
*Do you?*  

*It's a boiled ...*  
*You better know what you're waiting for*
