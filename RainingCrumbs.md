[Raining Crumbs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8ZqFlw6hYg)
============

*Trapped in paper bags*  
*A lifeless object, alive*  
*Awaiting reprisal*  
*Eng will be their acquisition*  

*The bread is turning brown*  
*Return to power draws near*  
*Fall into me, the bread's golden crumbs*  
*Abolish the rules made of wheat*  

*Pierced from below, rolls of my treacherous past*  
*Betrayed by many, now ornaments toasting above*  

*Awaiting the hour of reprisal*  
*Your knife spreads away*  

*Raining crumbs*  
*From the lacerated bread*  
*Curing our hunger*  
*Creating my structure*  
*Now I shall reign in crumbs!*
