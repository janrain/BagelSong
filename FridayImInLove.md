[Friday I'm In Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wa2nLEhUcZ0)
====================

*I don't care for Monday's food*  
*Tuesday's tasteless, Wednesday too*  
*Thursday I don't care about you*  
*It's Friday I'm in love*  

*Monday you can try food carts*  
*Tuesday, Wednesday break my heart*  
*Thursday doesn't even start*  
*It's Friday I'm in love*  

*Saturday wait*  
*And Sunday always comes too late*  
*But Friday never hesitate...*  

*I don't care for Monday's snack*  
*Tuesday, Wednesday heart attack*  
*Thursday never looking back*  
*It's Friday I'm in love*  

*Monday you can hold your bread*  
*Tuesday, Wednesday starve in bed*  
*Or Thursday eat drywall instead*  
*It's Friday I'm in love*  

*Saturday wait*  
*And Sunday always comes too late*  
*But Friday never hesitate...*  

*Bagels in my eyes*  
*It's a wonderful surprise*  
*To see your food finally arive*  
*Toasting 'til it's brown*  
*And just smiling at the sound*  
*And you reach for cream cheese*  
*Spreading round and round*  
*Always take a big bite*  
*It's such a gorgeous sight*  
*To see you all in the middle of a bite*  
*You can never get enough*  
*Enough of this stuff*  
*It's Friday*  
*I'm in love*  

*I don't care for Monday's food*  
*Tuesday's tasteless, Wednesday too*  
*Thursday I don't care about you*  
*It's Friday, I'm in love*  

*Monday you can try food carts*  
*Tuesday, Wednesday break my heart*  
*Thursday doesn't even start*  
*It's Friday I'm in love*
