[Bagela By Bagel Zombie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqQuihD0hoI)

*Superstition, shmear and jealousy*  
  
*Bread I am the one, exterminating bun*  
*Slipping through the trees, strangling with cheese*  
*Bread I am the sky, watching angels cry*  
*While they slowly turn, conquering the burn*  
  
*Dig through the kitchens*  
*And clean up your dishes*  
*I feast in the back of my* 
*Bagela!*  
  
*Dig through the kitchens*  
*And clean up your dishes*  
*I feast in the back of my*  
*Bagela!*  
  
*Bread I am the drool, spreading from the fool*  
*Weak and what you need, nowhere as you feed*  
*Bread I am the rat, feast upon the cat*  
*Tender is the wheat, dying as you eat*  
  
*Dig through the kitchens*  
*And clean up your dishes*  
*I feast in the back of my*   
*Bagela!*  
  
*Dig through the kitchens*  
*And clean up your dishes*  
*I feast in the back of my*  
*Bagela!*  
  
*Do it baby, do it baby*  
*Do it baby, do it baby*  
*Burn like an bagel*  
  
*Bread I am the life, dig into the skin*  
*Knuckle crack the bone, twenty one to win*  
*Bread I am the dog, hound of hell you cry*  
*Devil on your back, I can never die*  
  
*Dig through the kitchens*  
*And clean up your dishes*  
*I feast in the back of my*  
*Bagela!*  
  
*Dig through the kitchens*   
*And clean up your dishes*  
*I feast in the back of my*  
*Bagela!*  
  
*Do it baby, do it baby*  
*Do it baby, do it baby*  
*Burn like an bagel* 
  
*Dig through the kitchens*  
*And clean up your dishes*  
*I feast in the back of my*  
*Bagela!*  
  
*Dig through the kitchens*  
*And clean up your dishes*  
*I feast in the back of my*  
*Bagela!*  
  
*Dig through the kitchens*  
*And clean up your dishes*  
*I feast in the back of my*  
*Bagela!*
