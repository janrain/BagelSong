Bagel Hippie

Walk down, drop out of love,
Eat the bagel, I'm a hippie,
So said a truth, in bread,
A meal and yum,
You push the buttons.

Standing in line of fire,
For the hole,
My roll,
Cream cheese,
The spreads,
And salt,
Love the bagel,
Learn to live with everything.

Love love love, I'm a bagel hippie, yeah
Love love love, we're bagel hippies, yeah.

Zoom in, cut it, add cheese,
Make it feel so tasty
Warmed up, put down on plate,
Forget the jam it's far to sticky

Love love love, I'm a bagel hippie, yeah
Love love love, we're bagel hippies, yeah.

Love love love, I'm a bagel hippie, yeah
Love love love, we're bagel hippies, yeah.

Love love love, I'm a bagel hippie, yeah
Love love love, we're bagel hippies, yeah.
