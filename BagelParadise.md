[Bagel Paradise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpGbzYlnz7c)
==============

*As I walk through the kitchen feelin' hungry for bread*  
*I take a look at my knife and realise there's none left*  
*'Cause I've been working at Janrain so long that*  
*Even Jake Anders thinks that my mind is gone*  
*But I ain't never crossed a bagel that didn't deserve it*  
*Me turn down a jalape√±o, you know that's unheard of*  
*You better watch how you spreading, and where you treading*  
*Or you and your homies might be buttered instead*  
*I really hate to trip but I gotta lope*  
*As they cook I see myself in the toaster smoke fool*  
*I'm the kinda dev that little homies want to be like*  
*On my keys in the night, writing code in the street light*  

*They been spending Thursday nights dreaming of the bagel paradise*  
*They been spending Thursday nights dreaming of the bagel paradise*  
*We keep spending Thursday nights dreaming of the bagel paradise*  
*We keep spending Thursday nights dreaming of the bagel paradise*  

*They got the situation, they got me facing*  
*I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the strip*  
*So I gotta be down with the Vault team*  
*Too much condiment spreading got me chasing dreams*  
*I'm a caffeinated fool with bagel on my mind*  
*Got my bread in my hand and a gleam in my eye*  
*I'm a loped out gangsta set trippin banger*  
*And my homies is down so gonna rouse my hunger fool*  
*Bread aint nothing but a toasting away*  
*I'm living life do or die, what can I say*  
*Had twenty three never will I live to eat 24*  
*The way things is going I don't know*  

*Tell me why are we so blind to see*  
*That the hungry ones are you and me.*  

*They been spending Thursday nights dreaming of the bagel paradise*  
*They been spending Thursday nights dreaming of the bagel paradise*  
*We keep spending Thursday nights dreaming of the bagel paradise*  
*We keep spending Thursday nights dreaming of the bagel paradise*  

*Bagels in the toaster, turnin' up the power*  
*Minute after minute, hour after hour*  
*Everybody's running, but half of them ain't looking*  
*What's going on in the kitchen, but I sure know what's cooking*  
*They say I've got to eat but nobody's here to teach me*  
*If they can't understand it, how can they feed me*  
*I guess they can't*  
*I guess they won't*  
*I guess they front*  
*That's why I know my knife is out of luck fool*  

*They been spending Thursday nights dreaming of the bagel paradise*  
*They been spending Thursday nights dreaming of the bagel paradise*  
*We keep spending Thursday nights dreaming of the bagel paradise*  
*We keep spending Thursday nights dreaming of the bagel paradise*  

*Tell me why are we so blind to see*  
*That the hungry ones are you and me.*  

*Tell me why are we so blind to see*  
*That the hungry ones are you and me.*
