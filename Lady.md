============

*Bagel! when you're with me I'm smiling*  
*Give me all your love*  
*Your bread fills me up when I'm hungry*  
*Feed me and my troubles all fade*  

*Bagel! from the moment I saw you standing all alone*  
*You held all the cream cheese I needed*  
*So shy like a Cheerio that had grown*  
*You're my . . .*  

*Bagel of the morning*  
*Grains shine in your eyes*  
*Toasted, round and lovely*  
*You're my bagel*  

*Bagel! wake me up every Friday*  
*Show me all your charms*  
*Mornings when I toast you beside me*  
*Just take me gently into your arms*  
*You're my . . .*  

*Bagel of the morning*  
*Grains shine in your eyes*  
*Toasted, sliced and lovely*  
*You're my bagel*  

*Bagel of the morning*  
*Grains shine in your eyes*  
*Toasted, round and lovely*  
*You're my bagel*
