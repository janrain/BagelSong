[Bagel in the Bag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKAH7ZyZD68)
==================

*Your hand in the cheese*  
*Bakery charm around your neck*  
*Strung out and thin*  
*Calling some friend, trying to cash some check*  
*He's acting void*  
*That's what you've come to expect*  

*Bagel in the bag*  
*Bagel in the bag*  
*Bagel in the bag*  
*Bagel in the bag*  

*He's eating your breads*  
*Head down to toes, a reaction to you*  
*You say you know what he did*  
*But you idiot kid, you don't have a clue*  
*Sometimes they just get caught in the eye, you're pulling him through*  

*Bagel in the bag*  
*Bagel in the bag*  
*Bagel in the bag*  
*Bagel in the bag*  

*Now on the bus*  
*Nearly touching this bready retreat*  
*Falling out 6th and powell, a dead sweat in my teeth*  
*Gonna walk walk walk*  
*Four more blocks, plus the one in my brain*  
*Down downstairs to the man, he's gonna make it all okay*  
*I can't be myself*  
*I can't be myself*  
*And I don't want to talk*  
*I'm taking the cure*  
*So I can have bagel whenever I want*  
*So leave me alone*  
*You ought to be proud that I'm eating good foods*  

*Bagel in the bag*  
*Bagel in the bag*  
*Bagel in the bag*  
*Bagel in the bag*
