I fly like paper, hold food like plates
If you catch me at the toaster I got visas in my name
If you come around here, I make 'em all day
I get one down in a second if you wait

I fly like paper, hold food like planes
If you catch me at the toaster I got visas in my name
If you come around here, I make 'em all day

Sometimes I think sitting at desks
Every stop I get to I'm clicking my mouse
Everyone's a eater we're making that fame
Bonafide baker making my name

Sometimes I think sitting at desks
Every stop I get to I'm clocking that game
Everyone's a eater now we're making that fame
Bonafide baker making my name

Sticks and stones and yeast and eggs
Baking when we hit 'em
Lethal poison through their system
