[(My Bagel Is) Fly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUtnwcv-quE)
===================

*All around the edge, bagels crumble for me*  
*Who knows how soft the butter*  
*Everywhere I go people stop and they see*  
*Twenty-four hours old, my bagel has grown no mold*  

*I just want a bagel*  
*Put cream cheese upon me, baby*  
*Put cream cheese upon me, baby*  
*I just want a bagel*  
*Put cream cheese upon me, baby*  
*Put cream cheese upon me, baby*  

*Dance a little garlic, herb me where you've been*  
*Onions make you hostage; wanna eat it again*  
*There's no time to think about the toasting or the bread*  
*We'll find out I'm told, from a bagel's perfect hole*  

*I just want a bagel*  
*Put that butter on me, baby*  
*Put that butter on me, baby*  
*I just want a bagel*  
*Put that butter on me, baby*  
*Put that butter on me, baby*  
*I just want a bagel*  
*I just want a bagel*  

*All around the edge, bagels crumble for me*  
*Who knows how soft the butter*  
*Everything I know has so many good things*  
*Twenty-four hours old, my bagel has grown no mold*  

*I just want a bagel*  
*Put cream cheese upon me, baby*  
*Put cream cheese upon me, baby*  
*I just want a bagel*  
*Put cream cheese upon me, baby*  
*Put cream cheese upon me, baby*  
*I just want a bagel*  
*I just want a bagel*
