========

*Lost in a dream*  
*I don't know which one to eat*  
*A-let me say if you are all that you seem*  
*Then bagel, I'm eatin' way too slow*  
*I've been fooled before*  
*Wouldn't like to get my bread caught in the slammin' door*  
*How about some information, please?*  

*Eat up, now tell me*  
*Do you really wanna feed me forever*  
*Oh, oh, or am I caught in toast and run?*  
*Eat up, now tell me*  
*Is it gonna be you and me together*  
*Oh, oh, oh, or are you just bakin' buns*  

*Time's standing still waiting for some small clue*  
*I keep getting cheese when I think your nearly done*  
*I've been a fool before*  
*Wouldn't like to get my bread caught in the slammin' door*  
*How about some information, please?*  

*Eat up, now tell me*  
*Do you really wanna feed me forever*  
*Oh, oh, or am I caught in toast and run?*  
*Eat up, now tell me*  
*Is it gonna be you and me together*  
*Oh, oh, oh, or are you just bakin' buns*  

*You are so hard to read*  
*You play hide and seek with your ingredients*  
*If you're only playin' games, I'll just have to say:*  
*A b-b-b-bye, b-b-b-b-bye*  
*Do, do you feed me, do you feed me, bagel?*  
*Do, do you feed me, do you feed me, a hey bagel?*  
*Do, do you feed me, do you feed me, bagel?*  
*Do, do you feed me, do you feed me, a-tell me bagel!*  

*I've been fooled before*
