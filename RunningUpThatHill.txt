Running Up That Hill (for a Bagel)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wp43OdtAAkM

And if I only could, I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to bake us bagels
Be running up that road, be running up that hill
Be eating up that bagel if I only could, oh

You don't want to hurt me
But see how good the bagel tastes
Unaware, I'm feeding you a bagel
Ooh, there is thunder in our hearts
