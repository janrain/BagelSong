*Movin' to the city,*  
*gonna eat a lot of bagels*  
*Movin' to the city,*  
*Gonna eat me a lot of bagels*  
*Movin' to the city,*  
*gonna eat a lot of bagels*  
*Movin' to the city,*  
*gonna eat a lot of bagels*  
  
*Bagels come from a man,*  
*they were baked fresh in his van*  
*Near a factory downtown*  
*If I had my little way,*  
*I'd eat bagels every day*  
*Sun-soakin' bulges in the shade*  
  
*Take a little nap where the roots all twist*  
*Squished a rotten bagel in my fist*  
*And dreamed about you, woman,*  
*I poked my finger down inside*  
*Make a little room for some cheese to hide*  
*Bakers's candy in my hand or plate no lie*  
  
*Millions of bagels, bagels for me*  
*Millions of bagels, bagels for free*  
  
*Look out!*
