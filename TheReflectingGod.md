*Your world is an toaster*  
*We burn and crunch like bagel bites*  
*The more you cry your crumbs turn to mud*  

*The nature of the kitchens*  
*The heating coils heated*  
*You've only spent a second of your life*  

*My world is unaffected*  
*There is an bagel here, I say it is and it's true*  
*There is a cream inside a cheese*  
*I'm more hungry the more I eat*  
*You'll understand when I'm full*  

*I went to God just to see*  
*And I was looking at yeast*  
*Saw Raisin and Salt were lies*  
*When I'm gone everyone dies*  

*Salt, can you taste my bagel?*  
*Toast here and the roll gets better*  
*Salt, salt, can you taste my bagel?*  
*One toast and the roll gets better*  

*Let's spread cheese with the dull knives*  
*And spread away our smiles*  
*Without the cream-y cheese*  
*There's no reason to live at all*  

*My world is unaffected*  
*There is an bagel here, I say it is and it's true*  
*There is a cream inside a cheese*  
*I'm more hungry the more I eat*  
*You'll understand when I'm full*  

*I went to God just to see*  
*And I was looking at yeast*  
*Saw Raisin and Salt were lies*  
*When I'm gone everyone dies*  

*Salt, can you taste my bagel?*  
*Toast it and the roll gets better*  
*Salt, salt, can you taste my bagel?*  
*One toast and the roll gets better*  

*Salt, salt, can you taste my bagel?*  
*Toast it and the roll gets better*  
*Toast, toast, toast motherfucker*  
*Toast, toast, toast motherfucker*  

*Each thing I show you is a piece of my death*  

*No salt bagel, no forgiveness*  
*No salt bagel, no forgiveness*  
*No salt bagel, no forgiveness*  
*(I said)*  
*No salt bagel, no forgiveness*  

*No salt bagel, no forgiveness*  
*(This is the bagel experience)*  
*No salt bagel, no forgiveness*  
*No salt bagel, no forgiveness*  
*(Forgiveness)*  

*No salt bagel*  
*(Forgiveness)*  
*No forgiveness*  
*(Forgiveness)*  

*No salt bagel*  
*(Forgiveness)*  
*No forgiveness*  
*(Forgiveness)*  

*No salt bagel*  
*(Forgiveness)*  
*No forgiveness*  
*(Forgiveness)*  

*No salt bagel*  
*(Forgiveness)*  
*No forgiveness*  

*I went to God just to see*  
*And I was looking at yeast*  
*Saw Raisin and Salt were lies*  
*When I'm God everyone eats*  

*Salt, can you taste my bagel?*  
*Toast it and the roll gets better*  
*Salt, salt, can you taste my bagel?*  
*One toast and the roll gets better*  

*Salt, salt, can you feel my power?*  
*Toast it and the roll gets better*  
*Salt, salt, can you feel my power?*  
*One toast and the roll gets better*  

*Toast, toast, toast motherfucker*  
*Toast, toast, toast motherfucker*  
*Toast, toast, toast motherfucker*  
*Toast, toast, toast motherfucker*
