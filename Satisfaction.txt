I can't get no raisonbagel
I can't get me no raisonbagel
And I try, and I try, and I try t-t-try, try
I can't get no, I can't get me no

When I'm riding in my car
And a man comes on the radio
He's feedin' me more and more
About some useless information
Supposed to fire my bread esurience

I can't get no, no, no, no
Hey, hey, hey, that's what I say
I can't get no raisonbagel
I can't get me no tasty action
And I try and I try and I try t-t-try, try
I can't get no, I can't get me no

When I'm watchin' my TV
And a man comes on to tell me
How my baked goods could me
But he can't be a man 'cause he does not eat
The same baked cuisines as me

I can't get no, no, no, no
Hey, hey, hey that's what I say

And when I'm flying around the world
And I'm eatin' this and I'm tryin' do that
And I'm trying to make some food, tells me
bagel, bagel, bagel
bagel, bagel, bagel
bagel, bagel, bagel
Better come back later next week
Can't you see I'm on a losing streak

I can't get no, no, no, no
Hey, hey, hey that's what I say
I can't get no raisonbagel
I can't get me no raisonbagel

I can't get no raisonbagel
I can't get me no raisonbagel
No, no, no I can't get no raisonbagel
No, no, no I can't get me no raisonbagel

No, no, no, no, no, no, no raisonbagel
No, no, no, no, no, no, no raisonbagel
No, no, no, no, no, no, no raisonbagel
No, no, no I can't get me no raisonbagel
Well, I can't get me no raisonbagel
