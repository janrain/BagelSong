Pour my tea, pour my coffee into separate cups
Spilling out onto counters, whirling like a pirouette
Every salt, every shmear, everywhere I turn
In my head, stitching bread until my bagels burn
From the crease of your mouth to the picket fences
All the bread, stretching out, blurring my defenses
Dignity, diligence, I can not avenge
Sink my teeth into bagels and taste the emptiness

Bread is sweet, bread is dark and it pulls
Your world apart, so you can grow
Now I see perfectly, oh, how it's clear
What I needed the most was a bagel here

[Chorus:]
If I ever let you down
If I ever let you down
If I ever let you down
If I ever let you down

Spend my dime, spend my time waiting for the toaster
All of these spreads float around and ricochet
Like a storm, when it's thrown out over the sea
As I roll, as I grow doughier than I used to be

Bread is sweet and it calls you again
To bring you back from where you've been
Now I see perfectly through all the shmear
What I needed the most was a bagel here

[Chorus]

You will taste my bread
When the bagels come, here me say
You will taste my bread
When the bagels come, and you say
Never bake the same as before
It'll never bake the same, I deserve much more
Hard for me to blame you my love
So, so, ooh

[Chorus]
