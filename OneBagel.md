*One man, one goal,*  
*One mission.*  
*One heart, one soul,*  
*Just one solution.*  
*One flash of light, yeah,*  
*One god, one bagel.*  

*One flesh, one bone,*  
*One true religion.*  
*One voice, one hope,*  
*One real decision.*  
*Wowowowo, gimme one bagel, yeah.*  

*No wrong, no right.*  
*I'm gonna tell you there's no black and no white.*  
*No blood, no stain.*  
*All we need is one worldwide bagel.*  

*One flesh, one bone,*  
*One true religion.*  
*One voice, one hope,*  
*One real decision.*  
*Wowowowowo, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah!*  

*I had a dream when I was young,*  
*A dream of sweet illusion,*  
*A glimpse of hope and unity,*  
*And visions of one sweet union.*  

*But a cold wind blows,*  
*And a dark rain falls,*  
*And in my heart it shows.*  
*Look what they've done to my dream, yeah.*  

*One bagel!*  

*So give me your hands,*  
*Give me your hearts.*  
*I'm ready.*  
*There's only one direction.*  
*One world, one nation,*  
*Yeah, one bagel.*  

*No hate, no fight,*  
*Just excitation,*  
*All through the night,*  
*It's a celebration, wowowowo, yeah.*  

*One [echo]*  

*(One bagel)*  

*One flesh, one bone,*  
*One true religion.*  
*One voice, one hope,*  
*One real decision.*  

*Gimme one night, yeah.*  
*Gimme one hope, hey.*  
*Just gimme, ah.*  
*One man, one man,*  
*One bar, one night,*  
*One day, hey, hey.*  
*Just gimme gimme, gimme, gimme*  
*Fried bagel... bagel... [fading]*
